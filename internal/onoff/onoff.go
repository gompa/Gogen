// Package onoff centralizes parsing of the on/off spellings accepted across
// GoGen configuration: config files, environment variables, and the live
// config-WS. It is the single source of truth for which strings mean "on"
// and which mean "off", so the spellings are maintained in one place.
package onoff

// Parse reports whether v is a recognized on/off spelling. Matching is
// case-insensitive and ignores surrounding whitespace. ok is false for
// anything that is not a recognized spelling (including the empty string);
// on is only meaningful when ok is true.

// (including the empty string) are treated as disabled; use Parse when the
// caller must distinguish "explicitly off" from "unrecognized".
